He will have to handle the customers accordingly and make sure all the payments are made before the delivery is done. He has to find new prospects and expand the Cargo Group customer database. If a marketing campaign has to be set up, the Sales Manager will be the leader in the project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Warehouse Manager is the person responsible for the day-to-day management of the warehouse. He has to keep track of the orders and make sure the deliveries arrive where they have to be. He can assign delivery drivers to certain deliveries. He will have to make sure the handling of the goods is done well and that the goods are well ordered in the warehouse. The better he does his , the easier the delivery drivers can deliver the goods.\r\n\r\n\nThe delivery drivers are the ones who eventually make sure the company keeps going. They deliver the goods from the warehouse to the customers. They can contact the customers (via the information given on the request-sheet) and have to make sure the deliveries are only in the warehouse for the time needed and not a minute longer. The delivery drivers have to represent the company as good as possible, by actively delivering the orders and by treating the customers as good as possible.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------GENERAL INFO (Order & Delivery process)---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n~~~~~~ALSO SEE THE VERY BOTTOM SECTION FOR MORE SPECIFIC DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS AND STUFF~~~~~~\n\n1) The Request:\r\nResponsible: Sales Managers\n\r\nThis is the phase where the customer creates his order. He will take contact with the company to get his goods delivered. He will provide his name, address and eventually his order. The role of the person who handles this, is to make sure the customer receives a fair price and that the order gets forwarded to the correct people. \r\n\r\nLink: http://forums.owlgaming.net/forumdis...p?563-Requests\r\n\r\n2) The Pickup:\r\nResponsible: Anyone with Leader-status\n\r\nIn this phase, the goods will be picked up from the Las Venturas Airport. The step between the previous phase and this one, is to make sure the orders are complete and correct. If a player requested a generic, it must be the correct ID, and so-forth.\r\nOnce the goods are taken from the Airport, they will have to be brought to the warehouse.\r\n\r\n3) The warehouse management:\r\nResponsible: Warehouse Manager\r\n\r\nOnce the goods are delivered in the warehouse, the Warehouse Manager is responsible for them. He will have to classify them per order (per shelve or whatever system he has in mind) and notify the delivery drivers of the order, plus its location. He has to make sure the delivery drivers know where to find the order. \r\n\r\nIt is only when the warehouse manager notifies the delivery drivers that they will know if an order is ready to be delivered or not.\r\n\r\n4) The delivery\r\nResponsible: Delivery Drivers\r\n\r\nOnce they are notified of the order being ready, the delivery drivers can take a truck or van and contact the customer. They will have to call him to see if he\'s available. As long as a customer\'s order is not delivered, they will have to call him regularly. When they pick up, the delivery driver has to set up a meeting to deliver the goods, preferably as soon as possible. The aim is to let the goods in the warehouse for the shortest period possible.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RULES ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
